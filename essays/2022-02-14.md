# Invoice1


## A Brief Intro to Invoice1

```
Provide a brief introduction to the WOD along with a 
link to this page for further details
```

The most recent WOD, Invoice1, required us to create a sales receipt that includes: items, quantities, price, extended price, etc. The sales invoice is to dynamically compute the values (no hard coding) of variables such as sub-total and total. Along with those few things, we are expected to add comments describing what the line of code is/does. For more information on the Invoice1 WOD, you can click this <a href="https://dport96.github.io/ITM352/morea/060.expressions-operators/experience-invoice1.html">link</a> to go to the WOD page.

## Invoice1 Experiences

```
Discuss your experiences in performing the WOD. 
What worked well, what did you stumble on or slowed you down.
```
For Invoice1, overall I found the task to be slightly challenging in the sense that I had to really wrap my brain around how I wanted to go about computing dynamically. What worked well for me in terms of completing the WOD within a decent time frame was to first, try complete the WOD without a timer before timing myself the next few times. The part that I stumbled upon most was the portion in which I had to use string templates. To begin, I was still a little confused on how string templates were to be used, but after a bit more reading I was able to finally get it down.

## My Preparations

```
Describe what you to did to prepare. 
What did you do similarly or differently
from the WOD before this?
```

To prepare for Invoice1, I prepared before attempting the WOD by running through the assigned readings a few times. 

## Better Preparations/Next WOD

```
Discuss what you could have done to be better prepared and what you might try differently for the next WOD.
```

In completing future WODs, I found that it may be most efficient to first try to complete and narrate the WODs without worring too much about the timer. Yes, it is good to get a good time, however, I found that more times I completed the WOD and worked through it, the more easier it became to complete it. Of course, I did run into moments where I had to refer back to the screencast because I was completely stuck. I found it also very useful after submitting the WOD with my target time, to compare my results with the screencast as there were times where I did complete it a different way.
