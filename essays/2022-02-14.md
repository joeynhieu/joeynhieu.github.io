# Invoice1


## A Brief Intro to Invoice1

```
Provide a brief introduction to the WOD along with a 
link to this page for further details
```

The most recent WOD, Invoice1, required us to create a sales receipt that includes: items, quantities, price, extended price, etc. The sales invoice is to dynamically compute the values (no hard coding) of variables such as sub-total and total. Along with those few things, we are expected to add comments describing what the line of code is/does. For more information on the Invoice1 WOD, you can click this <a href="https://dport96.github.io/ITM352/morea/060.expressions-operators/experience-invoice1.html">link</a> to go to the WOD page.

## Invoice1 Experiences

```
Discuss your experiences in performing the WOD. 
What worked well, what did you stumble on or slowed you down.
```
For Invoice1, overall I found the task to be slightly challenging in the sense that I had to really wrap my brain around how I wanted to go about computing dynamically. What worked well for me in terms of completing the WOD within a decent time frame was to first, try complete the WOD without a timer before timing myself the next few times. The part that I stumbled upon most was the portion in which I had to use string templates. To begin, I was still a little confused on how string templates were to be used, but after a bit more reading I was able to finally get it down.

## My Preparations

```
Describe what you to did to prepare. 
What did you do similarly or differently
from the WOD before this?
```

To prepare for Invoice1, I prepared before attempting the WOD by running through the assigned readings a few times. It was easiest to have the readings open while working on WOD during the first run. In that way, I could try see if I can work my way to a solution through the readings. As this was the most challenging WOD for me so far, something I did differently was taking note on the parts I really found most challenging. By this I mean that whilst working through the WOD, I started taking notes on where I got stuck the most and writing out my thinking on paper in an attempt to visualize what I wanted. Also, something I notably did different from the other WODs is that I took the Professor and TA's advice to run-through the first attempt untimed. This helped me greatly as I was able to familiarize myself with the instructions and questions. 

## Better Preparations/Next WOD

```
Discuss what you could have done to be better prepared and 
what you might try differently for the next WOD.
```

What I could have done to be better prepared for the next WOD is spend more time refamiliarizing myself with the readings. I tend to overthink what I am doing, so generally I overthink how I should go about completing the tasks. What I may try differently when completing the next WODs is rather than completing the WOD to meet the required time, I may try to complete it a few more times to greater understand how it's done as its important to understand why I am doing it.
