```
My programming skills have greatly improved in the following ways:
```
<ul> Formatting </ul> 
* With formatting code, I learned to indent and better name variables/functions. </br>
  For example: </br>
  [Using underscores] </br>
  totalprice --> total_price </br>
  shippingcost --> shipping_cost </br>
</br><ul> Thinking "simple"</ul>
* By thinking "simple" I mean that I've found it easier to step by step plan what I would like my code to do and possible solutions to implement.


```
I need to work on the following to improve my programming skills:
```
<ul> Thinking 'efficiently' </ul>
* What I mean by this is that although I can break my code down into steps, I find it a tad challenging to implement a more efficient way. I tend to write my code in the most general way that comes to mind. This also tends to make the runtime of my code longer than it needs to be.
<ul> Implementing algorithms </ul>

I have learned a lot from doing WODs and I can do them without copying the screencast:
```
To 

```
The labs have help me learn and I am able to complete them with confidence:
```
What I could have done to be better prepared for the next WOD is spend more time refamiliarizing myself with the readings.



```
I learned a lot from my experience doing Assignment 1 and feel ready to work on Assignment 2:
```
What I could have done to be better prepared for the next WOD is spend more time refamiliarizing myself with the readings.


```
I think the class can be improved to help my learning in the following ways:
```
What I could have done to be better prepared for the next WOD is spend more time refamiliarizing myself with the readings.


```
What helps me the most in class are (WODs, Labs, class website, screencasts, readings, quizzes, one on one help, working with classmates, etc.):
```
What I could have done to be better prepared for the next WOD is spend more time refamiliarizing myself with the readings.
