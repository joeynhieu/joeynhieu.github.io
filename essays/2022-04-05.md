```
My programming skills have greatly improved in the following ways:
```
The most recent WOD, Invoice1, required us to create a sales receipt that includes: items, quantities, price, extended price, etc. The sales invoice is to dynamically compute the values (no hard coding) of variables such as sub-total and total. Along with those few things, we are expected to add comments describing what the line of code is/does. For more information on the Invoice1 WOD, you can click this <a href="https://dport96.github.io/ITM352/morea/060.expressions-operators/experience-invoice1.html">link</a> to go to the WOD page.


```
I need to work on the following to improve my programming skills:
```
For Invoice1, overall I found the task to be slightly challenging in the sense that I had to really wrap my brain around how I wanted to go about computing dynamically. What worked well for me in terms of completing the WOD within a decent time frame was to first, try complete the WOD without a timer before timing myself the next few times. The part that I stumbled upon most was the portion in which I had to use string templates. To begin, I was still a little confused on how string templates were to be used, but after a bit more reading I was able to finally get it down.


```
I have learned a lot from doing WODs and I can do them without copying the screencast:
```
To prepare for Invoice1, I prepared before attempting the WOD by running through the assigned readings a few times. It was easiest to have the readings open while working on WOD during the first run. In that way, I could try see if I can work my way to a solution through the readings. As this was the most challenging WOD for me so far, something I did differently was taking note on the parts I really found most challenging. By this I mean that whilst working through the WOD, I started taking notes on where I got stuck the most and writing out my thinking on paper in an attempt to visualize what I wanted. Also, something I notably did different from the other WODs is that I took the Professor and TA's advice to run-through the first attempt untimed. This helped me greatly as I was able to familiarize myself with the instructions and questions. 


```
The labs have help me learn and I am able to complete them with confidence:
```
What I could have done to be better prepared for the next WOD is spend more time refamiliarizing myself with the readings.



```
I learned a lot from my experience doing Assignment 1 and feel ready to work on Assignment 2:
```
What I could have done to be better prepared for the next WOD is spend more time refamiliarizing myself with the readings.


```
I think the class can be improved to help my learning in the following ways:
```
What I could have done to be better prepared for the next WOD is spend more time refamiliarizing myself with the readings.


```
What helps me the most in class are (WODs, Labs, class website, screencasts, readings, quizzes, one on one help, working with classmates, etc.):
```
What I could have done to be better prepared for the next WOD is spend more time refamiliarizing myself with the readings.
