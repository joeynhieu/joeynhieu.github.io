```
My programming skills have greatly improved in the following ways:
```
<ul> Formatting </ul> 
* With formatting code, I learned to indent and better name variables/functions. </br>
  For example: </br>
  [Using underscores] </br>
  totalprice --> total_price </br>
  shippingcost --> shipping_cost </br>
</br><ul> Thinking "simple"</ul>
* By thinking "simple," I've found it easier to step by step plan what I would like my code to do and possible solutions to implement.


```
I need to work on the following to improve my programming skills:
```
<ul> Thinking 'efficiently' </ul>
<ul> Implementing algorithms </ul> 

```
I have learned a lot from doing WODs and I can do them without copying the screencast:
```
To prepare for Invoice1, I prepared before attempting the WOD by running through the assigned readings a few times. It was easiest to have the readings open while working on WOD during the first run. In that way, I could try see if I can work my way to a solution through the readings. As this was the most challenging WOD for me so far, something I did differently was taking note on the parts I really found most challenging. By this I mean that whilst working through the WOD, I started taking notes on where I got stuck the most and writing out my thinking on paper in an attempt to visualize what I wanted. Also, something I notably did different from the other WODs is that I took the Professor and TA's advice to run-through the first attempt untimed. This helped me greatly as I was able to familiarize myself with the instructions and questions. 


```
The labs have help me learn and I am able to complete them with confidence:
```
What I could have done to be better prepared for the next WOD is spend more time refamiliarizing myself with the readings.



```
I learned a lot from my experience doing Assignment 1 and feel ready to work on Assignment 2:
```
What I could have done to be better prepared for the next WOD is spend more time refamiliarizing myself with the readings.


```
I think the class can be improved to help my learning in the following ways:
```
What I could have done to be better prepared for the next WOD is spend more time refamiliarizing myself with the readings.


```
What helps me the most in class are (WODs, Labs, class website, screencasts, readings, quizzes, one on one help, working with classmates, etc.):
```
What I could have done to be better prepared for the next WOD is spend more time refamiliarizing myself with the readings.
