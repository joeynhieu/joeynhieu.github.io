```
What did you learn from this assignment?
```
After completing this assignment, honestly speaking, I learned how to better manage my time. After assignment 1, it was important to manage my time wisely to fit the deadline while completing all necessary tasks. Some class topics that I better learned to understand is how to use the server to my advantage and processing requests with the server. There were some parts in which I had to go and find some research myself such as setting parameters for my textboxes, however, that I did find enjoyable. 
<br>

```
Did you work with a partner? Assign an estimated percentage on the amount each 
team member contributed to the assignment (including yourself).
```
<strong> I did not have a partner on this assignment. </strong>
<br>

```
How did you get help when you needed it? What did you need help with?
```
When I needed help, I went to look through our past work such as labs, workshops, readings, then resorted to asking the professor or looking online for readings that may help. I found myself stuck trying to get my errors to properly print out and also how to set the parameters of my textboxes so answers can only be submitted with a certain format.

```
How was developing this assignment different than assignment #1?
```
Developing this assignment was definitely more of a challenge as compared to assignment #1 as this assignment required more testing in my opinion. It was challenging in the sense that I found myself getting slightly confused when directing to the right pages. An example of this is redirecting to the login/registration page before the invoice. 
<br>

```
Estimate the % of time you spent (a) thinking about how to do something, (b) writing code (but do not include testing, (c) testing and debugging
```
Through the entire assignment, I would say I spent a good 45% thinking of how to do something, and the other 55% was spent trying to write out the code. It took me a while to take my idea and translate into code. 
<br>

```
Describe what worked well with this project? What did not work well?
```
What worked well with this project was the understanding of how to properly use HTML pages and HTML forms. This aided greatly in building my assignment. I also found that slowly building my assignment slowly, line-by-line, testing each change worked well as it made it easier to deduce the problem in my code and try to figure out what went wrong. What didn't work well was my pacing. I found myself spending more time stuck on problems that I eventually threw off the timing for my assignment. Given that, I think it would have been better for me to get a head start earlier than I normally would because I know I will end up needing more time to work out my errors. 
<br>

```
If you could go back in time and do things differently, what would you do differently?
```
If I could go back in time and do things differently, I would try get an earlier start as everytime I tried to use the server to test my assignment, there was always someone on which made it slightly challenging for me to run tests. I would also start earlier for the sake of giving myself more time to work out the small problems and leave more time later in the case that something doesn't work properly.
