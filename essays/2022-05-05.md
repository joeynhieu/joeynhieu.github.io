```
Show what each page will look like. The pages do not have to be “functional” but the design should clear. 
```
Link to screencast <a href="">here</a>

```
Describe your design for your site’s shopping cart. That is, will it be a separate page that the user can view and edit, or will it be integrated into the product pages? If so, describe in detail how this will work on your site. Provide several examples of using the cart.
```
<strong> I did not have a partner on this assignment. </strong>

```
Explain specifically how you will use sessions to manage your shopping cart. In particular, what shopping cart data will be stored in the session, what data format will be used (NOT what data type, but the format like with the data format used for your registration data). Use code examples showing what data structures (such as arrays and their objects) you will use to manage the shopping cart data and how they will be used in a session.

When I needed help, I went to look through our past work such as labs, workshops, readings, then resorted to asking the professor or looking online for readings that may help. I found myself stuck trying to get my errors to properly print out and also how to set the parameters of my textboxes so answers can only be submitted with a certain format.

```
How will you avoid access to your application when the user has not logged in or registered? What are the particular security concerns you must address?
```
Developing this assignment was definitely more of a challenge as compared to assignment #1 as this assignment required more testing in my opinion. It was challenging in the sense that I found myself getting slightly confused when directing to the right pages. An example of this is redirecting to the login/registration page before the invoice.

```
Upon a successful login, how do you provide personalization in your UI? Explain how you did or will do this (paste code if necessary)
```
Through the entire assignment, I would say I spent a good 45% thinking of how to do something, and the other 55% was spent trying to write out the code. It took me a while to take my idea and translate into code.

```
If you are working with partners, how will you split up the work in your team so that you are working in parallel as effectively as possible? That is, who is doing what and when?
```
What worked well with this project was the understanding of how to properly use HTML pages and HTML forms. This aided greatly in building my assignment. I also found that slowly building my assignment slowly, line-by-line, testing each change worked well as it made it easier to deduce the problem in my code and try to figure out what went wrong. What didn't work well was my pacing. I found myself spending more time stuck on problems that I eventually threw off the timing for my assignment. Given that, I think it would have been better for me to get a head start earlier than I normally would because I know I will end up needing more time to work out my errors.

How are you approaching Assignment 3 differently than Assignment 2?
```
I am approaching Assignment 3 differently than Assignment 2 as I have decided to start from scratch.
